            <p style="border: 2px solid green;background-color: rgb(110, 119, 116);">My name is Tesfay Hafte. I was born in Ethiopia, Tigray, Mekelle, Enderta. I grew up in this place with my family. I started my education at Adihawsi Primary School. I learned many things there and made friends. After primary school, I went to Sewuhungus for high school.  
                
                In high school, I worked hard to improve my skills and knowledge. I enjoyed learning and dreaming about my future. Now, I am a university student. I am studying computer science as my profession. I like working with computers and solving problems.  
                
                I want to use what I learn to help my community and create something useful. My journey is not easy, but I am proud of how far I have come. I believe education will help me achieve my dreams.
